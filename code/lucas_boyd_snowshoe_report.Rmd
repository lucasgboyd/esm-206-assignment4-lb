## 1. Introduction and Overview

Keilland Knut and their team conducted capture-recapture studies of
snowshoe hares as part of the Long Term Ecological Research Program at the University of Alaska. The following report is an overview of the differences in weight among
juvenile snowshoe hares in the Bonanza Creek Experimental Forest. First,
total observations (number of juvenile hares trapped) are examined
across each year of the study. Then, the difference in weight among male
and female juvenile hares is examined. Finally, a linear regression
model is used to understand the relationship between hind foot length
and weight. This exploration will serve to help us better understand
this important keystone species.

## 2. Data and Analyses

The
data contains observations for 3197 hares across 5 different sites in
the Tanana Valley between 1999 and 2012. Following exploratory data
visualization, weights of male and female juvenile hares are compared
using a two-sample t-test with a significance level of 0.05. Effect
sizes of the weights between sexes are described using Cohen's d. The
relationship between hind foot length and weight is explored using
simple linear regression. All analyses are in R version 4.0.2 using
RStudio version 1.3.1056.

```{r}
hares <- read_csv(here("data", "bonanza_hares.csv")) %>% 
  clean_names() %>%# cleaning names
  filter(age == "j") %>% # filtering for juveniles
  mutate(date = mdy(date)) %>% # converting date format
  mutate(year = year(date)) %>%  # creating a new year column
  mutate(sex = case_when( # changing names of observations
    sex == "f" ~ "Female",
    sex == "m" ~ "Male",)) %>% 
  mutate(grid = case_when(
    grid == "bonbs" ~ "BonBs", 
    grid == "bonmat" ~ "BonMat",
    grid == "bonrip" ~ "BonRip"
  ))
```

## 3. Preliminary Results

### A. Annual observations of juvenile hares

```{r}
hares_by_year <- hares %>% 
  count(year) # creating a subset for hare totals by year to explore the data
hares_by_year_mean <- mean(hares_by_year$n) # storing summary statistics
hares_by_year_max <- max(hares_by_year$n)
hares_by_year_min <- min(hares_by_year$n)
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = hares_by_year, aes(x = year, y = n)) + 
  geom_col(fill = "cyan4", width = 1, color = "white") + # creating a bar graph of trap counts
  labs(x = "Year", y = "Total Juveniles Trapped") +
  scale_x_discrete(limit = c(1999:2012)) + # manually putting ticks for x axis
  theme_grey()
```

**Fig. 1** shows total the total number of juvenile snowshoe hares
trapped and observed each year across all sites.

As illustrated in figure 1, number of juvenile trappings were not
consistent from year to year. The greatest number trapped was
`r hares_by_year_max` in 1999, the first year of the study. In 2002 and
2009, there were no juvenile observations collected. The mean number of
hares trapped by year was `r hares_by_year_mean`. While this appears to
show a downward trend in juvenile hare population, it could also be a
result of less effort put into data collection. Going forward,
researchers should be consistent about how many traps are set out and
how often they're checked to ensure accurate representations of snowshoe
hare populations.

### B. Weight comparison and descriptive statistics

```{r}
# group and summarize the data for use in the visual
hares_weight_by_site_summary <- hares %>% 
  group_by(sex, grid) %>% 
  summarize(
    mean_weight = mean(weight, na.rm = TRUE))
```

```{r}
# visualizing average hare weight by site and sex
ggplot(data = hares_weight_by_site_summary, 
       aes(x = sex, y = mean_weight, fill = sex)) +
  geom_col(width = 0.8) +
  facet_wrap(~ grid) + # faceting by site
  labs(x = "Sex", y = "Mean Weight (g)") +
theme(legend.position = "none") +
  theme_grey() +
  theme(legend.position = "None") # removing the legend
  
```

**Fig. 2** compares the mean weight (g) of male and female juvenile
snowshoe hares across the three collection sites. "NA" indicates that
the sex was unspecified.

Across all three sites, male juvenile snowshoe hares had a higher mean
weight (g) than females and juvenile hares with unspecified sex. Both
mean female and mean male weight was the highest at site "BonBs". This
seems to show that juvenile male snowshoe hares tend to be heavier than
females. There were no observations with unspecified sex at site
"BonBs".

### C. Juvenile hare weight difference analysis

**Table 1** Descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation, sample
size) of weight (g) of male and female juvenile snowshoe hares.

```{r}
hares_sex_table <- hares %>% 
  filter(sex %in% c("Male", "Female")) %>%
  drop_na(weight) %>% # filtering out unspecified sexes and weights
  group_by(sex) %>% # grouping by sex
  summarize( # finding summary statistics 
    mean_weight = round(mean(weight, na.rm = TRUE), 0), 
    sd_weight = round(sd(weight, na.rm = TRUE), 0), 
    sample_size = n())

hares_sex_table %>% # creating a stylized table with the stats
  kable(col.names = c("Sex", 
                      "Mean Weight (g)", 
                      "Standard Deviation (g)", 
                      "Sample Size")) %>% 
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped", full_width = FALSE)

```

```{r}
# storing vectors of male and female weights to use in t test

weight_male <- hares %>% # storing male weights
  filter(sex == "Male") %>% 
  drop_na(weight) %>% # dropping weights with na
  pull(weight) # pulling out a vector of just the weight column


weight_female <- hares %>% # storing female weights
  filter(sex == "Female") %>% 
  drop_na(weight) %>% # dropping weights with na
  pull(weight) # pulling out a vector of weights
  
```

```{r, include = FALSE}
# exploratory plots to check out the data
hist(weight_female) # normally distributed, slightly positively skewed
hist(weight_male) # semi-normal, arguably bimodal
qqnorm(weight_female) # relatively linear
qqnorm(weight_male) # troublesome, not very linear

# data is relatively normally distributed, meaning we can go ahead with the 2 sample t test
```

```{r}
# running a t.test of the weights
weight_by_sex_t <- t.test(weight_male, weight_female)

# finding and storing the actual difference in means
sex_weight_mean_difference = mean(weight_by_sex_t$estimate[1]) - 
  mean(weight_by_sex_t$estimate[2])

# finding and storing standard deviations for results
male_sd <- sd(weight_male)
female_sd <- sd(weight_female)

# finding and storing the effect size
sex_weight_effect_size <- cohen.d(weight_male, weight_female, na.rm = TRUE)
```

According to the results, juvenile male snowshoe hares (mean weight =
`r round(mean(weight_male), 0)` +/- `r round(male_sd, 0)`g) weigh
`r round(sex_weight_mean_difference, 0)`g more
(`r round((sex_weight_mean_difference)/(mean(weight_male)+mean(weight_female)/2)*100, 2)`%)
than females (mean weight = `r round(mean(weight_female), 0)` +/-
`r round(female_sd, 0)`g). This difference was determined to be
significant (Welch's two sample t-test: t(
`r round(weight_by_sex_t$parameter, 3)`) =
`r round(weight_by_sex_t$statistic, 3)`, p =
`r round(weight_by_sex_t$p.value, 3)`), and the effect size is
small-moderate (cohens d =
`r round(sex_weight_effect_size$estimate, 3)`).

### D. Relationship between juvenile weight and hind foot length

```{r}
# creating a visual of weight vs. hind foot length
ggplot(data = hares, aes(x = hindft, y = weight)) +
  geom_jitter(color = "cyan4", size = 1.5) +
  labs(x = "Hind Foot Length (mm)", y = "Weight (g)") +
  theme_grey()
```

**Fig. 3** examines the relationship between hind foot length (mm) and
weight (g) in juvenile snowshoe hares, seeming to indicate a positive
correlation between the two variables.

```{r}
# linear regression

hindft_weight_lm <- lm(weight ~ hindft, data = hares)

# tidy data frame of linear regression outputs
hindft_weight_lm_tidy <- tidy(hindft_weight_lm) 

# getting model-wide measures of uncertainty
lm_glance <- glance(hindft_weight_lm)

# making it report-ready with equatiomatic
hindft_weight_lm_eq <- extract_eq(model = hindft_weight_lm, use_coefs = TRUE)

# finding pearson's R for this relationship
pearsons_r <- cor.test(hares$hindft, hares$weight)
```

```{r, include = FALSE}
# exploring the linear regression results
summary(hindft_weight_lm)
plot(hindft_weight_lm)

```

The relationship between hind feet length and weight appears relatively
linear in juvenile snowshoe hares. A simple linear regression model
revealed that hind feet length significantly predicts weight (R^2^=
`r round(lm_glance$adj.r.squared[1], 2)`, p \<0.001), with an average
slope of `r round(hindft_weight_lm_tidy$estimate[2], 2)`. This means
that for every millimeter increase in hind foot length, we expect an
average weight increase of
`r round(hindft_weight_lm_tidy$estimate[2], 2)`g. Furthermore, hind feet
length and weight are positively correlated (Pearson's R =
`r round(pearsons_r$estimate, 2)`, p \< 0.001). The resulting linear
regression equation is as follows: `r hindft_weight_lm_eq`

The R^2^ value is small (`r round(lm_glance$adj.r.squared[1], 2)`), so
the linear regression model is only moderately adept at predicting
weight from hind foot length. Additionally, based on the exploratory
plots, the data appears to be heteroscedastic, with a greater variance
in data as hind foot length increases. For this reason, I would not rely
on a linear regression model alone to represent the relationship between
hind foot length and weight in juvenile snowshoe hares.

## 5. Summary

Our preliminary results reveal the following:

-   Total number of observations of snowshoe hares varies greatly year
    to year and appears to be declining. However, this could be
    explained by inconsistent data collection.

-   Juvenile male snowshoe hares tend to weigh more on average than
    females.

-   There appears to be a moderate positive correlation between juvenile
    snowshoe hare hind foot length and weight.

Next Steps:

-   Compare the relationship between hind foot length and weight in the
    entire population of snowshoe hares, to see if there is more
    evidence of a positive correlation

-   Apply multiple linear regression to model relationships between
    weight, sex, site, and age

-   Compare observation statistics with data collection behaviors to
    better understand juvenile hare population trends
